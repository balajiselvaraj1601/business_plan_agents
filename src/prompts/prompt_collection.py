def planning_prompt(feedback=None):
    """
    Generate a business planning prompt with optional feedback incorporation.

    This function constructs a comprehensive business plan topic generation prompt,
    optionally incorporating previous critique feedback for iterative improvement.
    The prompt integrates expert knowledge and uses structured frameworks to
    ensure comprehensive coverage of all business planning aspects.

    Args:
        feedback (Optional[Any]): Previous critique feedback to incorporate for
            iterative improvement. If provided, the prompt will include feedback
            processing instructions. Can be a FeedbackResponse object, dict, or
            any structured feedback data. Defaults to None for basic planning.

    Returns:
        str: Complete planning prompt string ready for AI model consumption.
            Includes PROMPT_PLANNING base template, and PROMPT_PLANNING_FEEDBACK
            if feedback is provided. Contains all necessary placeholders for
            business context and expert knowledge integration.

    Note:
        The returned prompt requires placeholder substitution before use:
        - {experts_information}: Expert domain knowledge from EXPERTS constant
        - {business}: Business type (e.g., "Falooda", "Coffee Shop")
        - {location}: Geographic location (e.g., "Sweden", "New York")
        - Additional placeholders when feedback is included

        When feedback is provided, the prompt enables iterative improvement
        by incorporating previous critique results for topic refinement.

    Example:
        >>> # Basic planning prompt
        >>> prompt = planning_prompt()
        >>> print("Basic prompt length:", len(prompt))
        >>>
        >>> # Planning with feedback for iterative improvement
        >>> feedback_data = {"score": 7, "weaknesses": ["Missing KPIs"]}
        >>> improved_prompt = planning_prompt(feedback=feedback_data)
        >>> print("Feedback-enhanced prompt length:", len(improved_prompt))
    """
    if feedback is not None:
        return PROMPT_PLANNING + PROMPT_PLANNING_FEEDBACK
    else:
        return PROMPT_PLANNING
